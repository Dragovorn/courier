Courier, the Discord Rich Presence integration for Dota 2! **Currently WIP**

Using
-----
Currently I am not distributing pre-compiled versions of Courier because I still think it's an incomplete
project and shouldn't be used in a production environment without further testing/development. But if you
really want to use it right now and you know how to use git and maven, feel free to clone the repo and build
it.

DISCLAIMERS
-----------
This shouldn't get you VAC'd because it uses Dota 2 Game State Integration, but if you do get VAC'd I am
in noway responsible for it, don't message me about it.

Main Menu, Ranked Medal, and Hero assets all belong to Valve Software, I do not own them.
